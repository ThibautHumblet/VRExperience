# AP University College - VR Experience
## Install
Because we're building a VR application in Unity, a couple of things need to be configured before we can start developing.
### 1. Clone this Github Repo & open it
Clone this repo by executing the following powershell command in your desired folder.
````
git clone https://github.com/ThibautHumblet/VRExperience.git
````
Afterwards open the folder in Unity.

### 2. Enable Preview Packages
In your Unity project, enable preview packages in Edit > Project Settings > Package Manager > Advanced settings

### 3. Install XR Interaction Toolkit
Install the XR interaction toolkit in your package manager. This can be done in Window > Package Manager > XR Interaction Toolkit > Install . Be sure you have enabled all packages from the Unity Registery. 

Now your ready to develop your own Unity VR Experience! Try playing around with all the different features and XR Components. If you're stuck, or if you need some inspiration, you can always check out this repo or visit the following useful guides;
